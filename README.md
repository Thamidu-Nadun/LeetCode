# LeetCode Solutions

![LeetCode Banner](https://assets.leetcode.com/static_assets/public/images/LeetCode_logo_rvs.png)

Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode solutions! This repository is a collection of problems I’ve solved in my own way as part of my learning journey and interview prep. I'm following the **NeetCode.io** roadmap, and this is my effort to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms (DSA).

## Introduction

In this repository, you’ll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is solved with a unique approach, allowing me to experiment and build my own understanding. This repository also serves as my preparation for coding interviews, where I aim to solve problems with efficiency, clarity, and optimization.

I’ve made sure to document each solution with:
- **Problem Link**: A link to the original problem on LeetCode.
- **My Explanation**: A simple breakdown of how I approached solving the problem.
- **Final Code**: The complete solution code, which I believe is clean and effective.

## Folder Structure

Here’s how I’ve organized my repository:

## Progress Tracking

Here’s a simple overview of my progress:

| Category  | Solved Problems | Total Problems |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Easy      | 10              | 50             |
| Medium    | 8               | 50             |
| Hard      | 3               | 30             |

I keep updating this table as I solve more problems, tracking my progress along the way.

## Solutions Details

Each solution includes:
1. **Problem Link**: Direct link to the problem on LeetCode.
2. **Explanation**: A detailed walkthrough of the problem and my approach.
3. **Code**: The final implementation in the appropriate programming language.

Feel free to explore each folder for categorized problems.
